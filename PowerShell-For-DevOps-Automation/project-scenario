ACI with non-ephemeral container instances:

1. Create a few azure container instances
2. Connect the container instances to a storage account
3. Ensure the containers are no longer in an ephemeral state due to the instances being connected to ACI

AKS cluster that's connected to ACI:

1. PowerShell and Azure CLI to create an AKS cluster
2. PowerShell creates burst instances from AKS to ACI by deploying the ACI connector. This is for your Kubernetes cluster to spin up containers within ACI rather than on pre-provisioned virtual machines (worker nodes)
3. PowerShell connects a storage account to ACI (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/virtual-kubelet-aci-burst/bursting-from-aks-to-aci-with-the-virtual-kubelet/)
