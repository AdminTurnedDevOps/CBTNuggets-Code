ACI with non-ephemeral container instances:

1. Create a few azure container instances
2. Connect the container instances to a storage account
3. Ensure the containers are no longer in an ephemeral state due to the instances being connected to ACI

AKS cluster that's connected to ACI:

1. PowerShell creates AKS cluster
2. PowerShell creates burst instances from AKS to ACI by deploying the ACI connector
3. PowerShell connects a storage account to ACI (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/virtual-kubelet-aci-burst/bursting-from-aks-to-aci-with-the-virtual-kubelet/)
